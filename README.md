## Purpose of the program
The purpose of this program is to maintain the original date of the photos, videos, files, and other media files (without EXIF data to have it stored) after unwanted modifications by third-party software. It also includes the functionality of renaming 'proprietary' files to KDIN convention.

This program uses the file-naming described in [Kjmaro](https://github.com/fjmaro/Kjmarotools/blob/main/kjmarotools/basics/conventions.py) convention to identify the file-date by its name.
